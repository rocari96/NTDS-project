# Can we estimate the earnings of a movie ?

We attempted to find a way to estimate the earnings of a movie, depending on the company and the people being involved in it, including actors, directors and producers.

This was done as a final project for the NTDS course during the fall semester of 2018.


### Prerequisites

You need to have a running version of ```python3``` and here is a list of all the python packages you need to have:

```
jupyter notebook
numpy
json
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
networkx
math
pyunlocbox
sklearn
```
You can install all of this packages using the ```pip``` command, i.e. ```pip install jupyter```, in your terminal.

### Run the notebook

You are now ready to run the file ```notebook.ipynb``` with Jupyter.

To save computation time, all the time consuming operations, like adjacency or laplacian calculation, have already been computed and saved into the ```data``` folder. You can either use these files or delete them before running the notebook if you want all the matrices to be recomputed, both options giving nevertheless the same results.
